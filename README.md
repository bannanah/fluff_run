## Fluff Run

Before attempting to run this project, make sure to have 
[Windows Visual Studio 2015](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/), 
[Cinder](https://libcinder.org/docs/guides/index.html), 
and a C++ IDE (such as [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download/#section=windows)) downloaded and set up.

This project is a parody of the Chrome Dinosaur Game. Check out the original at chrome://dino/ (or open Chrome when the internet is out). 

To run the game, click on the run button with the configuration set to the "fluff-run" option after cloning this GitHub 
repository into the IDE of choice and building it. The player will then be able to select the animal they want to play as using 
number keys ("1" for a cat and "2" for a rabbit) and the weather of the game background using letter keys ("a" for sunny weather 
and "s" for snowy weather). The game is pre-set to have a cat avatar and no weather if the player decides not to choose. 

Pressing the space bar will start the game and just like in the original, pressing the space bar during the game will 
cause the animal to jump over incoming obstacles. The game will end when the player fails to jump over an obstacle, 
leading to a Game Over screen. From there, pressing the space bar again will restart the game with the same animal and 
weather settings. Press "q" or close the app pop-up window at any time to stop the game.
